Second practice in Inteligencia Artificial (GRAU-IA) at FIB, UPC.

The purpose of the program is to make a knowledge-based system (KBS) in CLIPS that creates a training program for elders based on type of disease and physical shape. 

All code is written in CLIPS and must be run on the Windows CLIPS IDE. The instances and classes are created in Proteg√© and then imported to the .clp file.

The program is written by Mathias Dehli Klev and Lars Christian Ek Folkestad.
